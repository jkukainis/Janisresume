    At MIT I focused on business and operations courses to add to my technical training in engineering. I continued to focus on leadership and was elected to the Sloan Senate. Between my first and second year I interned at Apple, but ultimately took a role at Amazon as it offered me the opportunity to have direct reports and learn operations management from the ground floor.

    USMMA offered me the opportunity to not only improve my quantitative acumen through a degree in Marine Engineering, but also hands on experience in leadership, business management, and operations. I spent 250 days at sea learning ship operations, completed a 50 day internship at Newport News Shipyard, and served as a Drill Instructor for incoming midshipmen, and Squad and Platoon Commander responsible for the academic and regimental success of underclassmen and peers.
