    USMMA offered me the opportunity to not only learn the theory behind marine engineering, but also the ability to get hands on experience spending over 300 days onboard vessels and in shipyards. I also took full advantage of the leadership opportunities provided to me each year as a Drill Instructor for incomming Midshipman, and Squad Leader and Platoon Commander to underclassmen and peers.
