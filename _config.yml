  I have twelve years of experience in project management, product development, business development, and operations management. I have managed trades in the construction of 40,000-ton ships and have led teams of up to 1,500 people at Amazon shipping hundreds of thousands of packages a day to customers. My passion is identifying areas of opportunity and developing and implementing creative solutions to improve safety, engagement, quality, and productivity. In my personal life, I take great pride in my Latvian heritage, and am the Chairman of the Board for the largest non-profit Latvian cultural center outside of Latvia.

    I am most skilled in: <mark>Operations Management</mark>, <mark>Product Development</mark>, and <mark>Process Improvement</mark>.
